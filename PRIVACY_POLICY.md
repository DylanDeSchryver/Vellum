# Vellum Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 2025

Vellum ("the App") is designed with your privacy as a priority.

## Data Collection

Vellum does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

## Local Storage

All data, including your imported books, reading progress, bookmarks, and preferences, is stored locally on your device. This data is never transmitted to our servers because we don't have any.

## Third-Party Services

Vellum does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

The App connects to the following public APIs to help you discover and download public domain books:
- **Project Gutenberg** (via gutendex.com) — for searching and downloading free public domain ebooks
- **Standard Ebooks** — for accessing beautifully formatted public domain books

These services may have their own privacy policies. Vellum only sends search queries to these services when you use the Discover feature; no personal information is transmitted.

## File Access

Vellum only accesses files that you explicitly choose to import into the app. The App does not access any other files on your device.

## Children's Privacy

Vellum does not collect any data from any users, including children.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL.
