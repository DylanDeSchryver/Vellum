## Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy Text:**

```
VELLUM PRIVACY POLICY

Last Updated: December 2024

Vellum ("the App") is designed with your privacy as a priority.

DATA COLLECTION
Vellum does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The App operates entirely offline and does not make any network requests.

LOCAL STORAGE
All data, including your imported books, reading progress, bookmarks, and preferences, is stored locally on your device. This data is never transmitted to external servers.

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
Vellum does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

FILE ACCESS
Vellum only accesses files that you explicitly choose to import into the app. The App does not access any other files on your device.

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Vellum does not collect any data from any users, including children.

CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL.

CONTACT
For questions about this privacy policy, contact: [your email]
```

**Hosting Options:**
1. GitHub Gist (free) - Create a public gist and use the raw URL
2. GitHub Pages (free) - Create a simple HTML page
3. Notion (free) - Create a public Notion page
4. Your personal website

## App Privacy (Data Collection Declaration)

### Third-Party Content Declaration

**Question:** "Does your app contain, show, or access third-party content?"  
**Answer:** ✅ **Yes, it contains, shows, or accesses third-party content, and I have the necessary rights**

*Reason: The app accesses Project Gutenberg (via gutendex.com API) and Standard Ebooks to search and download public domain books. These are freely licensed/public domain sources.*

---

### Data Types to Declare: **NONE**

In App Store Connect, under App Privacy:

1. **Do you collect data from this app?** → **No**

**Why "No" is still correct:**
- Your app does not collect, store, or transmit user data to YOUR servers
- You have no analytics, no user accounts, no tracking
- The search queries go to gutendex.com (a public API), but YOU don't collect that data
- Third-party public APIs you call are not the same as third-party SDKs that track users

**Note:** Search queries sent to Project Gutenberg/Standard Ebooks are visible to those services, but this is standard API usage — not data collection by your app.
